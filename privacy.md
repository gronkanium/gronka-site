# Privacy Policy

**Last Updated:** July 7, 2026

## Introduction

This privacy policy describes how gronka ("we", "our", or "the service") handles data when you use our Discord bot service. We are committed to protecting your privacy and being transparent about our data practices.

## Information We Collect

### Data from Discord

When you use gronka, we may receive the following information from Discord:

- **User Information**: Your Discord user ID and username (as provided by Discord's API)
- **Message Content**: Video and image files you submit for conversion or optimization, and social media URLs you submit for download
- **Command Usage**: Information about when and how you use bot commands

### Automatically Collected Data

- **File Hashes**: BLAKE3 hashes of processed files for deduplication purposes
- **Usage Statistics**: User-specific metrics about bot usage (number of conversions, file sizes, command usage, etc.)
- **Error Logs**: Technical information when errors occur (may include your Discord user ID and file metadata, but not file contents or message text)

## How We Use Your Information

We use the collected information to:

- Process and convert your video and image files to GIF format
- Download media from social platforms at your request
- Store converted and downloaded files and serve them via our CDN
- Prevent duplicate processing of identical files
- Monitor service health and diagnose technical issues
- Generate usage statistics for service monitoring

## Data Storage

### File Storage

- Converted GIFs and downloaded media files are stored on our servers
- Files are identified by BLAKE3 hash
- Files may be linked to user information through processing records for operational purposes
- Files may be cached indefinitely for CDN performance
- Some downloaded files served via the CDN are stored temporarily and deleted automatically after a set period

### Logs

- Server logs may contain Discord user IDs for operational purposes
- Logs are retained for troubleshooting and may be kept indefinitely unless manually deleted
- Error logs do not contain file contents or personal messages

## Data Sharing

We do not sell, trade, or rent your personal information to third parties. We may share data only in the following circumstances:

- **Service Providers**: With hosting providers and CDN services necessary to operate the bot
- **Legal Requirements**: When required by law or to protect our rights
- **Discord**: Information is shared with Discord as part of normal bot operation (per Discord's Terms of Service)

## Your Rights

You have the right to:

- **Access**: Request information about what data we have about you
- **Deletion**: Request deletion of your data (subject to technical limitations)
- **Opt-Out**: Stop using the bot at any time

To exercise these rights, contact us via email at gronkasupport@proton.me or through the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/thedorekaczynski/gronka).

## Data Security

We implement reasonable security measures to protect your data:

- Files are stored securely on our servers
- Access to data is restricted to necessary system operations
- We use industry-standard practices for data protection

However, no method of transmission over the internet is 100% secure. While we strive to protect your data, we cannot guarantee absolute security.

## Children's Privacy

Our service is not intended for users under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect information from children under 13. If you believe we have collected information from a child under 13, please contact us immediately.

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this privacy policy from time to time. We will notify users of any material changes by updating the "Last Updated" date at the top of this policy.

Your continued use of the service after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.

## Contact Us

If you have questions about this privacy policy, please contact us:

- **Email**: gronkasupport@proton.me
- **GitHub**: [https://github.com/thedorekaczynski/gronka](https://github.com/thedorekaczynski/gronka)

## Third-Party Services

This service uses the following third-party services:

- **Discord**: Bot platform and API provider
- **Cloudflare**: CDN and tunnel services
- **Hosting Provider**: Server infrastructure

These services have their own privacy policies governing data handling.

When you use the download command, the URL you submit is fetched from the source platform (e.g. Twitter/X, TikTok, Instagram, YouTube) by download tools running on our own infrastructure. The source platform sees the request from our servers, not from you, and its own privacy policy governs that interaction.

## Data Retention

- **Media Files**: Retained indefinitely unless manually deleted, except temporary CDN uploads, which are deleted automatically after a set period
- **Logs**: Retained indefinitely unless manually deleted
- **Statistics**: User-specific statistics are retained indefinitely
- **Processed URLs**: Records linking URLs to files and user IDs are retained indefinitely
- **User Data**: User IDs, usernames, and usage timestamps are retained indefinitely
- **Moderation Records**: If you are banned from the service, your user ID and the ban reason are retained indefinitely

## International Data Transfers

Your data may be processed and stored in countries other than your own, depending on where the service is hosted.

## Compliance

We aim to comply with applicable data protection laws, including GDPR for EU users and CCPA for California residents, to the extent applicable to this service.
